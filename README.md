# Python Homework
## Description

The python homework for Tumo Labs ClimateNet project. Introduction to python syntax, simple algorithmic excersises.

## Objectives

-   Introduction to Python Basic Syntax
-   Understand and apply basic Python syntax and concepts.
-   Work with loops, conditions, and functions.
-   Practice with mutable and unmutable object types in Python

### Key Components

-   **ex1**: Write a Python code that will repeatedly prompt the user to choose between two options: 1 and 2. If the user selects 1, they should be able to input a number, and the program will continue prompting for another choice. If the user selects 2, the program will stop the loop and display the sum of all previously inputted numbers.

-   **ex2**: Asks the user to input a number and determines if the number is even or odd. If the user inputs 0, the program exits the loop. It uses the modulus operator (%) to check if the number is divisible by 2, which defines whether the number is even or odd. The program also includes error handling to ensure that only valid integers are processed.

-   **ex3**: A simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user selects an operation from a menu, inputs two numbers, and the program outputs the result of the chosen operation. If the user selects 5, the program exits. It includes error handling to manage invalid inputs and prevents division by zero.

-   **ex4**: Game where the program generates a random number between 1 and 10, and the user has to guess what the number is. The program gives hints like "Too high" or "Too low" based on the user's guess. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number, and then it displays the number of attempts taken to guess correctly. It also ensures that only valid numbers are entered.
